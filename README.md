# About Me 

----------------
With around three years of experience as an IT Operations Analyst, I've focused on optimizing service operations and enhancing client satisfaction. I'm now eager to apply my analytical mindset to create impactful business solutions and consistently deliver high-quality results in fast-paced environments.

This portfolio showcases projects I completed while pursuing my Data Science & Artificial Intelligence diploma at Loyalist College in Toronto. It highlights my hands-on work with tools like Python, Hadoop, SQL, and Tableau. Throughout these projects, Iâ€™ve built essential skills for data science, from identifying and exploring problems to data cleaning, sampling, building and assessing predictive models, and translating insights into compelling visualizations. Some projects involved teamwork, reflecting my ability to collaborate effectively and deliver data-driven insights that solve real-world business challenges.

I'm currently looking to work as a data scientist, data analyst, or business intelligence analyst.
